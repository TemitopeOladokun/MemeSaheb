# Meme Saheb

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Meme Saheb is a [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) powered tool to generate original meme captions for a meme template. This is done via deep learning using architectures specialized for use in natural language processing and computer vision.

  - Independent and extensive dataset
  - Easy to set up
  - Very efficient
  - Short training time
  - You don't have to be funny if you can get AI to be that for you?

This project was first developed with [Abhijeet](www.github.com/abhijeetand21) and [Swatantra](www.github.com/swatantra13).

It was originally inspired by [Lawrence's work with Dank Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04510?source=techstories.org) as part of [CS 224N](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
